# Documentation Archive

This folder contains the original documentation files that were consolidated into the main README.md as part of following MLOps best practices.

## Archived Files

- **FINAL_SUMMARY.md** - Development summary (superseded by main README.md)
- **PROJECT_STATUS.md** - Project status tracking (superseded by main README.md)
- **PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md** - Project overview (merged into main README.md)
- **ORCHESTRATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Orchestration details (merged into main README.md)
- **QUICK_START_GUIDE.md** - Quick start guide (merged into main README.md)
- **RUN_INSTRUCTIONS.md** - Run instructions (merged into main README.md)

## Why Archived?

These files were consolidated following MLOps documentation best practices:

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Main README.md now contains all essential information
2. **User Journey Focus**: Documentation organized by user needs rather than components
3. **Reduced Complexity**: From 8 markdown files to 2 main files (README.md + API.md)
4. **Better Maintainability**: Easier to keep documentation up-to-date
