# Enhanced Premier League Match Predictor - Model Improvements

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Probability Outputs Instead of Just Predictions**
- **Before**: Model only returned predicted class (H/D/A)
- **After**: Model returns full probability distribution for all outcomes
- **Benefit**: Much more informative for betting and decision-making

### 2. **Brier Score Evaluation**
- **Added**: Brier score calculation for each class and overall
- **Purpose**: Proper evaluation metric for probabilistic predictions
- **Comparison**: Direct comparison with betting market performance

### 3. **Bookmaker Margin Removal**
- **Process**: Convert odds to probabilities and normalize to remove margin
- **Example**:
  - Original odds: H=2.10, D=3.20, A=3.50
  - Implied probabilities: 0.476, 0.313, 0.286 (total = 1.074)
  - Bookmaker margin: 7.44%
  - Adjusted probabilities: 0.443, 0.291, 0.266 (total = 1.000)

### 4. **Enhanced Model Architecture**
- **Improved Parameters**:
  - n_estimators: 100 â†’ 200 (better probability estimates)
  - max_depth: None â†’ 10 (prevent overfitting)
  - min_samples_split: 2 â†’ 20 (more robust)
  - min_samples_leaf: 1 â†’ 10 (smoother probabilities)
  - class_weight: None â†’ "balanced" (handle imbalanced data)

### 5. **Better Feature Engineering**
- **Added Features**:
  - Implied probabilities from odds (margin-adjusted)
  - Day of week (weekend vs weekday effects)
  - Better handling of team encodings
- **Feature Count**: 5 â†’ 10 features
