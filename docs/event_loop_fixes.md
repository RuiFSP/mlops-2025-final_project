# Event Loop and Simulation Fixes

## Issue Summary
The simulation was encountering "event loop is closed" errors and attempting to trigger retraining even when there were no matches in a week.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Event Loop Management**: The async Prefect client was trying to create/use event loops improperly when called from the simulation
2. **Unnecessary Retraining Triggers**: The retraining orchestrator was being called even for weeks with no matches
3. **Deployment Name Conflicts**: The Prefect client was using incorrect deployment name formats

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Improved Week Handling in Season Simulator
```python
# Only call retraining orchestrator if we have actual matches and performance data
if week_performance and week_performance.get("accuracy") is not None:
    retraining_triggered = self.retraining_orchestrator.check_retraining_trigger(
        week_number, week_performance
    )
```

### 2. Enhanced Retraining Orchestrator Logic
```python
def check_retraining_trigger(self, week: int, performance_data: dict) -> bool:
    # Skip if no meaningful performance data
    if not performance_data or not performance_data.get("accuracy"):
        logger.debug(f"Skipping retraining check for week {week} - no performance data")
        return False
    
    # Only trigger time-based retraining if we have accumulated some data
    if self._check_time_based_trigger(week) and len(self.performance_buffer) >= 2:
        trigger_reasons.append("time_based")
```

### 3. Robust Event Loop Management
```python
# Handle event loop management more robustly
try:
    # Try to get existing event loop
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
    logger.debug("Found running event loop, using ThreadPoolExecutor")
    
    # Use ThreadPoolExecutor to run async function in separate thread
    import concurrent.futures
    
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        # Run the async function in a separate thread with its own event loop
        future = executor.submit(
            lambda: asyncio.run(
                self.prefect_client.trigger_deployment_run(...)
            )
        )
        flow_run = future.result(timeout=timeout + 10)
        
except RuntimeError as e:
    if "no running event loop" in str(e).lower():
        logger.debug("No running event loop, creating new one")
        # Create and manage our own event loop
        loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
        asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
        
        try:
            flow_run = loop.run_until_complete(...)
        finally:
            # Clean up the event loop
            try:
                loop.close()
            except Exception as cleanup_error:
                logger.debug(f"Event loop cleanup issue: {cleanup_error}")
```

### 4. Fixed Deployment Name Handling
```python
# Handle deployment names correctly
original_name = deployment_name
if "/" not in deployment_name:
    # Use deployment name as-is (it's already the correct format)
    pass
else:
    # If it has a '/', take the part after '/' 
    deployment_name = deployment_name.split("/")[-1]
```

## Results

### Before Fixes
- ❌ Event loop crashes when no matches in week
- ❌ Unnecessary retraining attempts for empty weeks
- ❌ "Event loop is closed" errors
- ❌ Deployment name not found errors

### After Fixes
- ✅ Simulation continues smoothly through weeks with no matches
- ✅ Retraining only triggered when there's meaningful performance data
- ✅ Robust event loop management with fallback strategies
- ✅ Correct deployment name resolution
- ✅ Graceful error handling and recovery

## Key Improvements
1. **Smart Week Skipping**: Weeks with no matches are skipped without trying to trigger retraining
2. **Conditional Retraining**: Only attempt retraining when there's actual performance data to analyze
3. **Event Loop Isolation**: Use ThreadPoolExecutor to run async code in separate threads when needed
4. **Fallback Mechanisms**: If Prefect fails, simulation continues with fallback retraining simulation
5. **Better Error Handling**: More descriptive error messages and recovery strategies

## Testing
- ✅ Complete demo runs successfully with 10 weeks
- ✅ Handles weeks with no matches gracefully
- ✅ Retraining triggers work correctly for performance degradation
- ✅ Time-based retraining only triggers when there's sufficient data
- ✅ Prefect integration works with proper deployment names

## Future Improvements
- Add more sophisticated performance monitoring
- Implement model performance drift detection
- Add configurable retraining strategies
- Enhance Prefect flow monitoring and reporting
