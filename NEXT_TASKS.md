# MLOps System - Remaining Tasks & Issues

**Status**: Core system is operational with 3 active Prefect workflows

## üö® Critical Issues to Fix

### 1. System Status Endpoint (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Issue**: `/system/status` endpoint returns 500 Internal Server Error
**Impact**: Dashboard system monitoring not working properly
**Location**: `src/api/enhanced_api.py` line ~300-350
**Steps to Fix**:
- [ ] Debug the `get_system_status()` function
- [ ] Check database connection logic
- [ ] Fix service health check implementations
- [ ] Test endpoint returns proper JSON response

### 2. Error Handling & Logging (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Issue**: Some API endpoints have inconsistent error responses
**Impact**: Difficult to debug issues in production
**Steps to Fix**:
- [ ] Standardize error response format across all endpoints
- [ ] Add proper HTTP status codes for different error types
- [ ] Implement structured logging with correlation IDs
- [ ] Add request/response logging middleware

## üîß Technical Improvements

### 3. Data Validation & Quality Checks (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Issue**: Limited data validation in pipelines
**Impact**: Poor data quality could affect model performance
**Steps to Implement**:
- [ ] Add data schema validation for incoming Premier League data
- [ ] Implement data quality checks (missing values, outliers, etc.)
- [ ] Add data freshness monitoring
- [ ] Create data quality dashboard/alerts

### 4. Model Performance Monitoring (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Issue**: No automated model performance tracking
**Impact**: Model drift detection not possible
**Steps to Implement**:
- [ ] Implement model drift detection
- [ ] Add performance degradation alerts
- [ ] Create model comparison workflows
- [ ] Automated model retraining triggers

### 5. Enhanced Monitoring & Observability (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Issue**: Limited monitoring of system health and performance
**Steps to Implement**:
- [ ] Add Prometheus metrics collection
- [ ] Implement Grafana dashboards
- [ ] Create alerting rules for workflow failures
- [ ] Add performance metrics (latency, throughput)

## üöÄ Feature Enhancements

### 6. Real-time Prediction Updates (LOW PRIORITY)
**Current**: Static predictions via API calls
**Enhancement**: WebSocket-based live updates
**Steps to Implement**:
- [ ] Add WebSocket support to FastAPI
- [ ] Update Streamlit dashboard for real-time data
- [ ] Implement prediction streaming
- [ ] Add live match score integration

### 7. Advanced Machine Learning Models (LOW PRIORITY)
**Current**: RandomForest classifier
**Enhancement**: Deep learning models for better accuracy
**Steps to Implement**:
- [ ] Research LSTM/Transformer architectures for match prediction
- [ ] Implement neural network training pipeline
- [ ] Add model comparison and A/B testing framework
- [ ] Integrate advanced feature engineering

### 8. CI/CD Pipeline (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Issue**: Manual deployment and testing
**Steps to Implement**:
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] Add automated testing on pull requests
- [ ] Implement staging environment
- [ ] Add automated Docker image building and deployment

## üêõ Known Bugs & Minor Issues

### 9. Container Resource Optimization
**Issue**: Containers may be using more resources than necessary
**Steps to Fix**:
- [ ] Optimize Docker images (multi-stage builds)
- [ ] Set appropriate resource limits
- [ ] Review and optimize package dependencies
- [ ] Implement health checks for all containers

### 10. API Documentation
**Issue**: API documentation could be more comprehensive
**Steps to Improve**:
- [ ] Add comprehensive OpenAPI documentation
- [ ] Include request/response examples
- [ ] Add authentication documentation (if implemented)
- [ ] Create API usage guides

## üìä Performance & Scaling

### 11. Database Optimization
**Issue**: Current database setup is basic
**Steps to Implement**:
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Add database indexing
- [ ] Implement connection pooling
- [ ] Consider database migration to PostgreSQL

### 12. Caching Layer
**Issue**: No caching for frequently accessed data
**Steps to Implement**:
- [ ] Add Redis for API response caching
- [ ] Cache model predictions
- [ ] Implement data caching for dashboard
- [ ] Add cache invalidation strategies

## üîê Security & Reliability

### 13. Authentication & Authorization
**Issue**: No authentication system implemented
**Steps to Implement**:
- [ ] Add API key authentication
- [ ] Implement user management
- [ ] Add role-based access control
- [ ] Secure sensitive endpoints

### 14. Backup & Recovery
**Issue**: No backup strategy for data and models
**Steps to Implement**:
- [ ] Implement automated data backups
- [ ] Create model artifact backups
- [ ] Add disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Test backup restoration processes
