### Common Issues

#### Database Connection Issues
- PostgreSQL service is not running
- Connection parameters are incorrect
- Database tables haven't been created

Solution: Run `python scripts/fix_database.py`

#### Model Loading Issues
- MLflow tracking server is not running
- Model artifacts are missing or corrupted
- Model registry references are outdated

Solution: Check the MLflow UI for registered models and ensure the correct model version is set as active.

#### Port Conflicts
- Another application is using port 8501

Solution: Kill the process using the port or specify a different port:
```bash
streamlit run src/dashboard/streamlit_app.py --server.port 8502
```

#### Mock Data
The dashboard is designed to show mock data when real data is not available. This allows you to explore the interface even if some components are not working.
