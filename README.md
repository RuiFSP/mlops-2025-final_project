## 🔍 Pre-Commit Hooks & Quality Checks

### Automatic Quality Checks
Pre-commit hooks are set up to automatically run quality checks before each commit:

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks (one-time setup)
uv run pre-commit install

# Now every git commit will automatically run:
# ✅ Code linting and formatting (ruff)
# ✅ Type checking (mypy - optional)
# ✅ Unit tests (pytest)
```

### Manual Quality Checks
Run all quality checks manually before committing:

```bash
# Run all checks at once
python scripts/run_checks.py

# Or run individual checks
uv run ruff check src tests   # Linting
uv run ruff format src tests  # Format code
uv run mypy src              # Type checking
python -m pytest tests/     # Run tests
```

### Pre-Commit Workflow
With pre-commit hooks installed, your workflow becomes:

```bash
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "your message"  # Hooks run automatically here!
# If hooks pass → commit succeeds
# If hooks fail → commit blocked, fix issues and try again
git push origin main
```
