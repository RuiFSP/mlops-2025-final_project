# Full season batch simulation
python scripts/simulation/run_simulation.py --mode batch
```

## ü§ñ Automated Retraining System ‚úÖ

### **üéØ Concept: Enterprise-Grade Automated MLOps**

A production-ready automated retraining system that monitors model performance and automatically triggers retraining when conditions warrant it. The system provides intelligent monitoring, safe deployment, and comprehensive observability.

### **üöÄ Implementation Complete**

‚úÖ **Phase 1: Core Scheduler** - COMPLETE
- **AutomatedRetrainingScheduler**: Background monitoring with multiple trigger types
- **RetrainingConfig**: Flexible configuration management with YAML support
- Thread-safe operation with concurrent retraining prevention

‚úÖ **Phase 2: Retraining Flow** - COMPLETE
- **Prefect-based Workflow**: Complete retraining pipeline with validation gates
- **Model Backup & Versioning**: Automatic backup before retraining
- **Performance Validation**: New models must improve to be deployed

‚úÖ **Phase 3: API Integration** - COMPLETE
- **RESTful Endpoints**: Full API for managing retraining operations
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time scheduler status and history
- **Configuration Management**: Runtime configuration updates

### **üìã How It Works**

```
Continuous Monitoring:
  1. Monitor model performance metrics
  2. Track data drift and prediction volume
  3. Evaluate time-based triggers
  4. Check multiple conditions simultaneously
    ‚Üì
Intelligent Triggering:
  - Performance degradation (>5% accuracy drop)
  - Data drift detection (statistical tests)
  - Time-based (max 30 days without retraining)
  - Volume-based (prediction count thresholds)
    ‚Üì
Safe Retraining Process:
  1. Backup current model with timestamp
  2. Prepare training data (historical + new)
  3. Train new model with latest hyperparameters
  4. Validate against performance thresholds
  5. Deploy only if improvement is significant
  6. Generate comprehensive report
```

### **üíª Usage Examples**

```bash
# Start Prefect server and serve deployments
prefect server start &
python deployments/deploy_retraining_flow.py &

# Start automated retraining scheduler
python scripts/automation/manage_retraining.py start

# Check current status
python scripts/automation/manage_retraining.py status

# Manually trigger retraining via Prefect deployment
python scripts/automation/manage_retraining.py trigger --reason "performance_drop"

# Interactive demo showcasing Prefect deployment integration
python scripts/automation/demo_prefect_deployments.py --full

# API management (with API server running)
curl http://localhost:8000/retraining/status
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/retraining/trigger \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"reason": "manual_test", "force": true}'
```

### **‚öôÔ∏è Configuration**

```yaml
# config/retraining_config.yaml
performance_threshold: 0.05  # Trigger if accuracy drops by 5%
drift_threshold: 0.1         # Trigger if drift score exceeds 10%
max_days_without_retraining: 30
check_interval_minutes: 60
enable_automatic_deployment: false  # Safety: manual approval
```
