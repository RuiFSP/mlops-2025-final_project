# Premier League Match Predictor

A complete end-to-end MLOps pipeline for predicting Premier League match outcomes using real historical data and modern Python tooling.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project successfully demonstrates a production-ready MLOps pipeline that:
- ✅ **Collects real data** from football-data.co.uk (3,040+ matches from 8 seasons)
- ✅ **Trains ML models** with enhanced probability outputs (55% accuracy - excellent for football)
- ✅ **Serves predictions** via FastAPI REST API with probability distributions
- ✅ **Tracks experiments** with MLflow
- ✅ **Uses modern tooling** (`uv`, `pyproject.toml`, Docker)
- ✅ **Evaluates with Brier score** - professional probabilistic evaluation
- ✅ **Compares with betting market** - removes bookmaker margin for fair comparison

## 🏆 Key Achievements

- **Real Data Integration**: Successfully integrated 8 seasons of Premier League data
- **Enhanced Model**: 55% accuracy with probability outputs (9% improvement)
- **Professional Evaluation**: Brier score evaluation and market comparison
- **Working API**: FastAPI service with probability distributions at `http://localhost:8000`

## 🔍 Pre-Commit Hooks & Quality Checks

### Automatic Quality Checks
Pre-commit hooks are set up to automatically run quality checks before each commit:

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks (one-time setup)
uv run pre-commit install

# Now every git commit will automatically run:
# ✅ Code formatting (black)
# ✅ Import sorting (isort)
# ✅ Linting (flake8)
# ✅ Unit tests (pytest)
```

### Manual Quality Checks
Run all quality checks manually before committing:

```bash
# Run all checks at once
python scripts/run_checks.py

# Or run individual checks
uv run flake8 src tests        # Linting
uv run black src tests         # Format code
uv run isort src tests         # Sort imports
uv run mypy src               # Type checking
python -m pytest tests/       # Run tests
```

### Pre-Commit Workflow
With pre-commit hooks installed, your workflow becomes:

```bash
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "your message"  # Hooks run automatically here!
# If hooks pass → commit succeeds
# If hooks fail → commit blocked, fix issues and try again
git push origin main
```
