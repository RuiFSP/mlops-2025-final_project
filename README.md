    ‚Üì
Safe Retraining Process:
  1. Backup current model with timestamp
  2. Prepare training data (historical + new)
  3. Train new model with latest hyperparameters
  4. Validate against performance thresholds
  5. Deploy only if improvement is significant
  6. Generate comprehensive report
```

### **üõë Stopping All Services**

When you're done working with the system, here's how to properly shut down all services:

#### **Option 1: Using Makefile (Recommended)**
```bash
# Stop all services gracefully
make stop-all
```

#### **Option 2: Manual Service Shutdown**
```bash
# Stop individual services (if running in separate terminals)
# Press Ctrl+C in each terminal running:
# - MLflow server (Terminal 1)
# - Prefect server (Terminal 2)
# - API server (Terminal 4)

# Or kill by process name
pkill -f "mlflow server"
pkill -f "prefect server"
pkill -f "uvicorn.*api"
pkill -f "python.*api"
```

#### **Option 3: Kill All Python Processes (Nuclear Option)**
```bash
# ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This will kill ALL Python processes
# Only use if you're sure no other important Python scripts are running
pkill -f python

# More targeted approach - kill specific port processes
lsof -ti:5000 | xargs kill -9  # MLflow (port 5000)
lsof -ti:4200 | xargs kill -9  # Prefect (port 4200)
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9  # API (port 8000)
```

#### **Option 4: Check What's Running**
```bash
# See what services are currently running
ps aux | grep -E "(mlflow|prefect|uvicorn|api)" | grep -v grep

# Check specific ports
lsof -i :5000  # MLflow
lsof -i :4200  # Prefect
lsof -i :8000  # API

# Check all Python processes
ps aux | grep python | grep -v grep
```

#### **Option 5: Complete System Reset**
```bash
# Stop all services and clean up
make clean-all

# This will:
# 1. Stop all running services
# 2. Clean up temporary files
# 3. Reset any background processes
# 4. Clear log files (optional)
```

#### **Service-Specific Shutdown Commands**

**MLflow Server:**
```bash
# If started with make
pkill -f "mlflow server"

# If you have the PID
kill <mlflow_pid>
```

**Prefect Server:**
```bash
# Stop Prefect server
pkill -f "prefect server"

# Stop Prefect worker (if running)
pkill -f "prefect worker"
```

**API Server:**
```bash
# Stop FastAPI/Uvicorn
pkill -f "uvicorn.*api"
pkill -f "python.*deployment.*api"
```

#### **Verification Commands**
```bash
# Verify all services are stopped
curl http://localhost:5000/health 2>/dev/null || echo "MLflow stopped ‚úÖ"
curl http://localhost:4200/api/health 2>/dev/null || echo "Prefect stopped ‚úÖ"
curl http://localhost:8000/health 2>/dev/null || echo "API stopped ‚úÖ"

## üöß Known Issues & Future Improvements

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Current Issues to Address**

1. **Event Loop Warnings During Simulation**
   - **Issue**: WARNING-level event loop messages appear during rapid retraining triggers
   - **Impact**: Cosmetic only - system functions correctly but logs are verbose
   - **Root Cause**: Expected behavior at async/sync boundaries when triggering Prefect flows
   - **Workaround**: Rate limiting (30s minimum between triggers) reduces frequency
   - **Fix Priority**: Low (cosmetic issue, no functional impact)

2. **Simulation Performance Optimization**
   - **Issue**: Realtime simulation could benefit from better async handling
   - **Impact**: Slight performance overhead during concurrent operations
   - **Current State**: Functional with rate limiting, but could be more efficient
   - **Fix Priority**: Medium (performance enhancement)

3. **Model Validation Edge Cases**
   - **Issue**: Occasional model validation warnings in rapid retraining scenarios
   - **Impact**: Validation still passes, but generates warning logs
   - **Current State**: ModelTrainer save/load methods work correctly
   - **Fix Priority**: Low (warnings only, functionality intact)

### üöÄ **Planned Improvements**

#### **High Priority**
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: More granular error classification in Prefect integration
- **Performance Metrics Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of system performance
- **Configuration Validation**: Stronger validation for retraining configuration parameters

#### **Medium Priority**
- **Cloud Deployment**: AWS/GCP deployment with proper infrastructure as code
- **Advanced Monitoring**: Integration with Prometheus/Grafana for system metrics
- **Multi-Model Support**: Framework for managing multiple model versions simultaneously
- **A/B Testing Framework**: Infrastructure for comparing model performance in production

#### **Low Priority (Enhancements)**
- **Advanced ML Features**: Ensemble methods, deep learning models
- **Real-time Data Streaming**: Kafka/RabbitMQ integration for live data ingestion
- **Advanced Drift Detection**: More sophisticated drift detection algorithms
- **Mobile API**: React Native/Flutter app for match predictions

### üîß **Development Notes**

#### **System Architecture Decisions**
- **ThreadPoolExecutor**: Used for async/sync boundary management - working correctly
- **Rate Limiting**: 30-second minimum prevents event loop overload - optimal setting
- **Prefect Deployments**: Using deployment triggers instead of direct function calls - production pattern
- **ModelTrainer Integration**: Save/load via temporary directories - reliable pattern

#### **Testing & Validation Status**
- **Core System**: 77/77 tests passing ‚úÖ
- **Prefect Flows**: All deployments executing with COMPLETED status ‚úÖ
- **API Endpoints**: All endpoints functional and tested ‚úÖ
- **Simulation Engine**: Successfully handles full season simulation ‚úÖ

#### **Performance Baselines**
- **Model Accuracy**: 60-77% (excellent for football prediction)
- **API Response Time**: <100ms for predictions
- **Retraining Time**: 30-60 seconds per cycle
- **Simulation Speed**: 5-week simulation in ~30 seconds with rate limiting

### üìù **Contributing Guidelines**

When addressing issues or implementing improvements:
1. **Maintain Test Coverage**: All changes must include appropriate tests
2. **Preserve Rate Limiting**: Don't remove rate limiting without alternative solution
3. **Document Async Patterns**: New async code should follow established ThreadPoolExecutor patterns
4. **Validate with Simulation**: Use season simulation to test MLOps changes
5. **Monitor Prefect Integration**: Ensure all changes work with Prefect deployment architecture

**Last Updated**: July 11, 2025 - Full MLOps automation achieved with working Prefect flows and realtime simulation
